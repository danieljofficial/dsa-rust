The solution i came up with is to 
- convert the string argument into an vector
- create a new vector to hold the chars in desired non repeating substring
- loop through the vector with the string argument
- check if the current item is in the vector of substrings
- if it is continue
- if it is not add it then increase and return the count

But this is not correct because it fails for strings like pwwkew with a conse
cutive w.
We are supposed to use the sliding window approach to solve this problem
- first we convert the string argument into a vector 
- In this operation there would be two pointers one to the left and the other to the right
of the window
- define the first pointer as a variable the second one would be the current 
value/position in the vector we are iterating over
- we loop over the numbers in the length of the vector 0..vector.len()
- while the current letter vector[right] being looped over exists in the set
- remove the value of the left pointer in the vector - vector[left] 
- add 1 to the left pointer
- do this until the value of the right pointer is no longer in the window/set.
- once the while condition is false insert the value of the right pointer into the vector
- then set the max length to equal the maximum value between the current max length
and the difference between the right and the left pointer + 1
- return the max length outside the loop.
