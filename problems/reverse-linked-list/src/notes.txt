What I think about this problem is that we are to take two lists, reverse 
the order of each one and then take each item in the list as a number, 
after that we will add both resulting numbers. The sum should be reversed 
and each number placed in a new list.
The reversal is a way to throw off the person solving the question, 
just add the numbers in each list then carry the remainder if the sum is over
10. The math we need to replicate is simple, the problem is execution. The math
is exactly the same as adding two three digit numbers on paper where 
you carry over if a pair adds up to > 10.
Something else to note is that while you can liken the process to normal 
3 digit number addition it is quite different. In regular addition you add
from right to left to get the correct answer, to solve this problem 
without writing code to reverse your answer we are effectively adding the
numbers in reverse from left to right. i.e. Instead of adding and carrying
to the left you add and carry to the right giving you the reversed result 
directly.
- To implement this you define the starter node/head.
- create new references to both lists
- define a variable for the number carried over 
- while there are still digits to process or there is still a carry
- get the value of each node from both lists 
- move to the next node
- calculate the new digit and carrying
- add new node to result
- skip dummy head and return real result which is the next_node
